God of assassins, serpents and poisons.

Zahir may not have been a betrayer God, but it's not possible to prove that. The God is super discrete. Information about the fact, during the Calamity, Zahir was abstent (as far as anyone knew). Many of his deeds were enacted through his followers. Most of his followers were anihilated during the Calamity. Worshipers of Zahir are hunted down.

Most of the Gods and Betrayer Gods can attribute an enemy. Zahir is a bit more wily? and both Melora (the wild mother) and Arathis (goddess of law and justice) are cannonicaly a partnership. Both of them despise Zahir. The ambiguous chaos he represents. But also among the Betrayers. He's a betrayer's Betrayer God.

The biggest cult to Zahir is located near [[Ank'Harel]], in the [[Serpentwind Peaks]], outside of the city.
