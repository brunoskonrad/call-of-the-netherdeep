## Tarot

Seems like everyone's kinda tense right now. I wanna, if there's a way you can let me know how I can keep everyone together. Make sure that we all are okay.

- **Deva, a solar. Above flies a raven. On wings out-stretched.** this is the card of **Help and Healing**. You have provided for so long for those around you.
- **It is a grave with black fearnes growing around it**. The card of **Exhaustion**, frustration. Card of feeling like one is beset by evils. And can do nothing about it.
- **Warrior against the red sky, looking far away.** the card of **Change**, and it is reversed. Sometimes the change that we need to see isn't in the world around us, but within ourselves.
