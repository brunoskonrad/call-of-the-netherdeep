## What do you want to do besides fighting?

Going back to Jigow. Fishing, farming. Maybe becoming a hunter in the town.

"Look after the town" - words by [[Herschel Rigo]].

Has a lot of guilt within. Ran away from the combat. Took three arrows on the back.

## Tarot

Love!
- **Catha**. A dense jungle. In the trees, stock a lion. It is a new romance. Blossoming.
- **Secrecy** someone is keeping things from the other.
- **?**. Raspit? Calm before the storm. Moments to clear the air. To talk. To say the things that need be said.
