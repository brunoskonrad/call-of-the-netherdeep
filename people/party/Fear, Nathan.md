## Tarot

- **Person, who stands before the full red moon**. Somber look on their face. Card of caution. A warning. It is _she taps the moon on it_. When Catha appears on the cards, it means you're on the favour of the moon. When Ruidus comes, it appears you're parhaps on the verge of falling.
- **Image of a bird. A Hawk. Currently bound in what it appears to be nettings or chains**. Reversed. Restraint. But it is reversed. In many ways, you are too restraint. Perhaps you are holding yourself back.
- **Full temple, before the temple sits a single person. Their knees are not together. The black hooded cloak obscures the face, body features. In the hands, they hold a black orb. A radiating light from it**. Is also the first card. The first in the deck of cards. It is the card of **Secrecy**. Thou shalt have the cover of night by which to yield thy heart.
