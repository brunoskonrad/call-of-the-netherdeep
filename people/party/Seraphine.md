Was married once. Killed her wife. Could've done something about. Could've been more careful.

[[Shammel]] is where she's from.

## Tarot

- **Harmony, reversed**. Come from remorse. Such great tragedy. The things that tear us down are the things that builds us to...
- **Adventure** back sillouete of a man, with two swords in hand, with the back to a dune. She's on a grand adventure.
	- On his feet, a body. The swords covered in blood.
	- Not only the card of adventure, but the card of eff. The grand journey has many challenges ahead.
- Golden stalions, grand wings raising from them. In the distance: storm, towers of a fortress that is crumbling and cracking. **Card of conflict**. Well, not all journeys end up hapilly.
- Pulls another card, **the card of love**. "Much nicer, isn't it?"
