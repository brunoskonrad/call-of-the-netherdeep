# Dust (NPC)

#people #ankharel #npc

Tabaxi tobacco merchant in [[Ank'Harel]]. Used to run a smoking house at [[The Shade]]. Used to charge folks to use its back room.

The [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]] was the last client using this said back room when the [[Allegiance of Allsight]] expelled them from there. Because of this whole situation, Dust lost ownership of the Shade.
