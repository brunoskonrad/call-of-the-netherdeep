# Prolix Yusef

A red Tiefling and scholar. Presented himself to the party on the way up to the Betrayer's Rise, in Bazzoxan.

Described as a Tiefling man, "who is here looking into ways to seal the reefs in the abyss".

When approaching the party, Prolix seemed nervous, and he was asking for our heroes to help him find his missing bag/chest.

Said bag/chest was found inside one of the Fiends flying monsters (pending name) the party has just defeated.

The party refused to give Prolix the bag/chest. Turns out these belong to *the lady in red*, and not to Prolix, who was trying to get his hand on her items.

After that, he proceeded to go down back to Bazzoxan. What were his intentions with these items is unknown.

I don't recall who gave us the information that he is a member of the [[Allegiance of Allsight]].
