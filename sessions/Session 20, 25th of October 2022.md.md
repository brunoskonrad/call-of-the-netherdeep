Recap - we are in [[Betrayers Rise]]

Ozark & Herschel searched the Driders - 11 investigation

Long bow, Longsword x2 Wysp doesn’t want these weapons so Herschel thinks he’s unwell or something is not right. It’s prob just trauma tbh.

Stained glass needs opening - need to dance again? Kleion remembers the order to press and we try that or see if fire returns. Nathan offers to help with mage hand to press the order of symbols.

We wait 10 mins for Kleion to cast detect magic ritually. Herschel offered a find traps

There are sconces with fire and black chains on the floor and big holes? at the end of the hall. Herschel druid crafts some flowers, they die/wither and then chains break the stems.

Wysp asks if the chains are attached to the walls - they are weaved in everywhere and through the walls. Entire ground covered in chains.

When Herschel makes more flowers outside the tunnel they wither too but don’t get stems broken. Not the same as the chain tunnel.

We try to pull down statues from the hallway so we can use them over chains - the walls also don’t have chains.

20ft tall - hands of statues at 10ft

Purrschel tries to run through - wis save - fail uh oh - Gets real heavy and pushes down to ground into chains. Dex save success! Purrschel doesn’t get bent

Dispel Magic on chains doesn’t help.

Morok gets caught in chains.

Nathan & Wysp & Kleion are trying to help each other do better wis saves. Wysp gives Kleion a medal of maze for ad on wis saves and Nathan hastes Kleion.

Wysp takes up the end to help people if they fall

OH NO Nathan failed! uh oh! It makes humanoids go into a sort of creepy prayer mode - damage. Wysp grabs Nathan and pulls him out of the chains. They move like spooky snakes.

There’s now a horrible pit. 5ft pit then a big opening! Fantastic. Perception for magical effects. Below the pit is a big statue with an arm. Bright abjuration magic from the statues hand.

Wysp feather falls folks down the hole and Viro does a jump. Ozark also jumps and wiffs it a bit.

Wysp tries to catch Viro and rages to try to cushion a fall → Vines helped lower Viro’s fall damage. But they both eat a certain amount of shit as they fall. 

We see this creepy statue dude, he looks happy?! The exoneriated is his name:

On the three hands/arms there are gross tumor things on there that are magical!

uh oh cha saves and we roll initiative! there also some wis saves ah nerds

Nathan casts fireball on his friends :( others are also under this effect where we attack each other → it’s sad!!!! omg

Purrschel attacks [[Wysp]] - [[Nathan]] saves the wis and blinds [[Wysp]]. Blinded Wysp!

Wysp and Herschel are like mind controlled and are duking it out.

Herschel saves wis and tries to help by blessing folks. 

People run up the arms and start hacking at the purple things and like shooting stuff at them pew pew. Wysp looses his handaxes in the purple pustules. oh no he wants them back!

We attack the creepy hands purple tumor things and a Gross weird goat dudes come out of the hand pustules!

They smell bad and are gross. Con saves!

Nathan hits them with scorching ray!

[[Herschel]] moonbeams!

There are more demons but like with a black beetle-y shell? near [[Wysp]]? from a black portal hole in the ground → it creepy
