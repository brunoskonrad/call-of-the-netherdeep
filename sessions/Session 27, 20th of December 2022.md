#session

[[Vrill]], the Moth. SHE’S SHADY AF. She wants access to Ruidium. And we have a key for where this place is? The key being the Vestige of Divergence.

[[Viro of the Wood]] casts Zone of Truth. She proceeds to cast a spell to show Ruidium to the party, with our consent.

**[[Allegiance of Allsight]]**. Another group. Scholars. Excavations on [[Cael Morrow]]. Hold a monopoly on everything in it. Including Ruidium. According to [[Vrill]], they are amassing HUGE amounts of Ruidium, which can be dangerous.

If her studies proves true: perhaps it can free **some of us of a very trying curse**. Releasing this fate upon ourselves. She’s Ruidus born. Was born under a Ruidus flare/full moon.

[[Aradrine]] is the leader/founder of the [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]].

“**We are not fighters**”. They drove us out of [[The Shade]] (Place).

[[Dermot]] was scrying on us. He sends a message to [[Ozark the Scale Tamer]]. **AYO SAYS HI.**

[[Fear, Nathan]] is freaking out about WHO’S CHASING THEM.

We speak about changing sleeping place.

[[Calinao]] knows [[Vrill]] and told she stayed in the same basement as we did. She knows the network. IS SHE TRUSTWORTHY?

[[Fear, Nathan]] learned actual CURSE WORDS in Marquesian. [[Calinao]] taught him proper Marquesian.

[[Wysp Rigo]] asked to learn it, and [[Fear, Nathan]] taught everything he knows. [[Kleion]] taught a new one for Fear to use it on the FUCKING Tabaxi that trolled Nathan.

**Break**

We take a long rest. No issues. No weird vision.

We speak about what to do with our day. We firstly message [[Ayo]], and they’re out of town. They have a place for themselves. They’re not very specific with the answer.

Then we leave to go to the **************************Old Man Kruuk’s************************** place. Near the river district. It’s a bakery with no smell coming from it.

[[Kruuk]] is real scary. Clearly this place is a facade.

Some roleplaying. [[Wysp Rigo]] is going to teach [[Fear, Nathan]] and [[Viro of the Wood]] how to sword fight. Complaining about the bad day yesterday was.

[[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] notices a person that has been sort of following the party.

[[Viro of the Wood]] picks the man up, basically. WE ARE KIDNAPPING THIS PERSON. [[Rhiordan Khine]]. SHADY AF. He buys magic weapons. Eccentric fella.

This man seems to be part of the [[Cobalt Soul]]. He will take us to the Cobalt soul. And he also teaches a bunch of cuss words.
