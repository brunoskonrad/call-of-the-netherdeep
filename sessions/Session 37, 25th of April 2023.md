#session 

[[The Party]] starts discussing about plans. [[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] suggests going to speak with the [[Allegiance of Allsight]]. [[Herschel Rigo]] is in favour of going to a place of learning. Then we though about going after [[Zahir]]'s cult. Now we are planning about recovering the [[Ruidium Sword]] (a.k.a **Bad Times Sword**).

[[Herschel Rigo]] is not keen to break in any secret places. [[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] suggests us to rob the casino. Which is believed to be a front for the [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]]. However it is not, it seems. The [[Rivals]] were doing some mercenary work for the casino, only.

[[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] and [[Kleion]] know about the [[Sentinels of Memory]]'s tower. Tower of Memory. Located at the Guided District. 3 to 4 stories high. Several windows. Maybe to look for the Paladin, bodyguard. Possibly a member of the Sentinels.

[[The Party]] decides to split. Group Memory, [[Ozark the Scale Tamer]], [[Viro of the Wood]] and [[Fear, Nathan]], are to go to the [[Sentinels of Memory]]. The siblings [[Herschel Rigo]] and [[Wysp Rigo]] are to go to the [[Allegiance of Allsight]].

Group memory. People on the tower wear black robes, like priests/cultists, wearing golden masks, with symbols we do not recognize. The place is creepy. Not welcoming. We knock on the door.

"**The things of this world that are better left forgotten**" magic phrase. We enter the tower. It changes vibes from a very, very shady place to a more... cultish place.

One of the cultists asks us where are our clothing. We reply telling them we didn't receive anything yet so they promptly go fetch one set of black robes and golden mask for each. Then proceeds to feed us with cheese and cold cuts.

On the other side, [[Wysp Rigo]] and [[Herschel Rigo]] prepare themselves to enter the [[Allegiance of Allsight]]! They go speak with a human at the entrance. Asking them if they have an appointment. To be a guest in the [[Crystal Chateau]]. Long waiting list, unless you have credentials.

[[Herschel Rigo]] pulls up a letter from their Academy times, to try convincing the human they're scholars! Great news, waiting time is down to a week, only. Herschel tries to bullshit their way "oh, we have to talk about very important stuff with Prolix".

This man is trying to keep the siblings away, just because he can. Small powers, big ego. [[Herschel Rigo]]: "Look, you wanna be the one that messes up stuff about Caer Morrow? Or do you want me to start screaming in the middle of the street about you making a scene and about Cael Morrow?". Charisma roll: natural 20!

"Stay here, I'll be right back" the human goes inside. [[Herschel Rigo]] threats writing a letter to their academy, about the terrible experience on the [[Crystal Chateau]].

The gatekeeper returns: "Prolix is currently busy, but uhm he's speaking with the headmaster. I can put you on the waiting room until he's ready".

"That'll do" [[Herschel Rigo]] says. They go inside. It is a very inviting atmosphere inside. "Right in here, if you wanna make yourselves comfortable" says the gatekeeper.

The siblings make themselves *comfortable* inside [[Prolix Yusef]]'s office. [[Wysp Rigo]] tried to force the door shut while [[Herschel Rigo]] starts investigating Prolix's desk. The tiefling is very meticulous about his desk's organisation. There's one drawer that is currently locked.

A lot of papers are Exandria's version of photocopies. They're not handwriten. They're all mission reports. Those are not from the locked drawer. Some of the recent ones are related to the city of [[Ank'Harel]]. Many issues about picking clothes from the dry cleaning. Every. Single. Service he's done, [[Prolix Yusef]] keeps a record of.

- **Excursion to [[Bazzoxan]]**. Rumours regarding [[Ruidium]] insubstantial. Not a lot.
- Red Lady's interests, not a concern. [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]] are looking at the wrong place?
- Note to self: hate [[Bazzoxan]], never go back

The door starts to open. [[Wysp Rigo]] uses his body to force it shut. The sound of falling tea cups on the other side.

The Watcher awaits you, brethren. "Right away, Watcher". "What lies in [[Cael Morrow]] will be the devastation of Exandria, and all realms beyond".

It was men, overreaching, that cause the Calamity. Greedy. Desiring. We stand on the precipice. Of those same fault lines.

The [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]] seeks power
The [[Cobalt Soul]] seeks power.
The [[Allegiance of Allsight]] their own perosnal greed.

Leading them to their ruin.

"We will destroy Cael Morrow. We will bring down this excavation site. And bury the past, where it should be".

[[Viro of the Wood]] makes a point about removing threats. The Watcher is listening. "This is our goal".

"There's a great evil that has bleed his way into this world. A great corruption, long ago, the founder of our line ventured into the depths of the desert. To rid Marquet of this evil. A Deva radiant and pure, rave and powerful. But, the evil overwhelmed her. It ate into her. Ripped from her divinity. And proved a lesson from those who remained above ground. At whatever lies down there, should not be dealed with by men or by God. Only to be buried. Only to be forgotten. And left alone".

The Deva Perigee, from the Moonweaver, Sehanine. The Watchers are descendants of the Deva.

Viro places his hand on top of the sword. Charisma saving throw. He's cut from the [[Ruidium Sword]]. Two cultists appear. Roll for initiative.

Back to the [[Crystal Chateau]]. [[Prolix Yusef]] is scared of the siblings. [[Herschel Rigo]] summoned [[Twiggie]] and left it in Prolix's office. The siblings go after Prolix's, to the door where they're hidden on. Eventually, Prolix opens the door and the siblings enter in the headmaster's room.

They talk to the Headmaster, and the headmaster dismiss [[Prolix Yusef]], when [[Herschel Rigo]] reveals the imense amount of [[Ruidium]] in [[Bazzoxan]]. Herschel proceeds to explain why [[The Party]] wants to go down to [[Cael Morrow]].

The headmaster inquires for the both of them to be direct on the answers. Loads of lore.
