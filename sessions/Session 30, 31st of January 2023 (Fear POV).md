#session 

We lost the Ruidium Sword because of Henry, the bag. It links to a location in our plane, instead of a different pocket plane.

The sword was probably taken by the Thieve's Guild. Probably being sold to the [[Scarbearers]].

Some 20 years without rain in [[Ank'Harel]]. And it has rained last night. The [[Apothean, Alyxian]] revealed themselves.

"What is this thing for?" [[Wysp Rigo]] asking about the [[Jewel of Three Prayers]]. I shall find an answer for him.

Bowl of Judgement. We shall fight a Chimera.

// Good notes, Bruno.
