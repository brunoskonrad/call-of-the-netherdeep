#session 

We are good with the landlord. Maybe with [[Jamil Alianta]].

[[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] and [[Viro of the Wood]] are investigating about the Cloaked Serpent (book). Lore drop incoming: [[Zahir]], the so called Cloaked Serpent. God of assassins, serpents and poisons.

[[Allegiance of Allsight]] is beginning to push the [[Cobalt Soul]] outside of [[Cael Morrow]]. Something is happening.

[[Wysp Rigo]] has a great moment trying to get rid of the Deva's feather. The feather returned to him. He has a great conversation with [[Jamil Alianta]]. Drops the information bomb that we, [[The Party]], are sent by the Gods.

"Without them, I'm nothing" says Sehanine, the Moonweaver, as [[Fear, Nathan]] is embraced by [[The Party]] ([[Seraphine]], [[Herschel Rigo]] and [[Viro of the Wood]]).
