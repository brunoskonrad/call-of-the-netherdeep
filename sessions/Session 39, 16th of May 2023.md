#session 

The party reconvene to Wysp's Murder Alley.

[[Fear, Nathan]] casts Cure Wounds on [[Viro of the Wood]]'s wounded arm.

## The Book

[[Seraphine]] holds the old tome. Leather. Pages that have been sown into it, look have they've been done by hand. Not so well done. The paper is all uniquely dried and uniquely dyed. It give each peace of it a mismatch feel to it. The hand-write is uniform. Simialrly to the exterior olf the book. Pink-ish hue. Long dried splattered of blood. Just a few droplets. Some pages the words are not legible. You can read very well **IF** some difficulty. It is written in Elvish. Old, old Elvish. Something about it is **off**. Maybe it is **NOT** Elvish. And it is **not** Sylvan either.

"It is a record of some of the times of the Calamity. A record of some of the battles that have been fought. Names of the people involved. What looks like someone's first hand diary of the events. Some days will be as something as simple as "we wake up, some food is prepared for us. We keep watch. We fight creatures like nightmares. We have lost people (and then the record of those who fell)". This is a priceless treasure that we've stumbled upon. There are not a lot of records about the Calamity. The first couple of pages are just names.

Continuing on the pages: [[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] it reads like a field journal. Towards the end of it, the coming of The Ruiner. The one eyed God comes. We travel to Aeschyllius, we are small in number now. But determined in spirit. There are rumours that the Apothean himself will come. We believe that if we're able to join forces with this Godsend entity we can turn back the Betrayers.We can route The Ruiner before he can set his plans into motion.

We must succeed, because if we not, I fear for our continent and all life upon it. The sky is red with his approach. The sun is like an angry beam." There are a number of pages ripped out, following this entry.

The Bay of Gifts. Remain the same of pre-history to current history. We recognize the names and have a sense of this continent. But the descriptions are not what we experience of Marquet. It is not a desert, it is a lush forest.

We get to the end of these pages, a number of them ritp out, and on the last page there's a hastly drawn emblem. It is moon crescent, with a curve of a facing downards. Rising around it a symbol that is intriscintly woven with brancehs designs that twists and turns into fillagry winds. Above it, there are two back to back crescent moons. [[Jewel of Three Prayers]]? No. It is not. It is similar. Devas have their own symbol, their own design. This is the sigil of a Deva.

## Pidgeons

"Find small ears".
"No arm, no find".
"Small ears, says soon. See you soon. Help. Help".

## Kleion's eggs

- [[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] receives a green cloak from [[Kleion]]. **Cloak of Elvenkind**.
- [[Wysp Rigo]] receives a metal batton with galloping camels from [[Kleion]]. **Immovable Rod**.
- [[Viro of the Wood]] receives a green-ish in colour egg. Doesn't break like plaster? It rather unscrews. Inside you'll find a gewy, sticky substance that feels and smells like a tree sap from [[Kleion]]. **Keoghtam's Ointment**.
- [[Seraphine]] receives a blue egg. Will find inside the **Periapt of Wound Closure** from [[Kleion]]. "They're your problem now".
- [[Fear, Nathan]] rolls a 20. Receives an orange coloured egg. A guilded deck of cards from [[Kleion]]. Deck of playing cards, black with golden details. Pulls 2 of clubs. "For your performances" note. 19 cards left. **Deck of Illusions**.
- [[Herschel Rigo]] receives a purple egg with a tiger/panther mask from [[Kleion]]. Hears all sorts of wispers, growls, animal sounds. Very distant. **Mask of the Beast**.

## Wysp night walk

Going to the [[Life Dome]]. He sleeps under a bench, by the *park*. [[The Party]] joins him.

[[Viro of the Wood]] hears "so now, there's something that we share. You and I." says [[Apothean, Alyxian]]. The anger starts to fade, a bit.

The [[Apothean, Alyxian]] looks at [[Viro of the Wood]] with sad eyes."What is the meaning of this?" - "If it softens any, I never wished for this. This was never my intention. It followed my steps, this... Curse. Or whatever you have it. I wanted none of it. I do not know if it came from me or was done to me. Or if it existed because of me". says the Apothean.

"You're talking about the sickness? I have recently come down with" says [[Viro of the Wood]]. The [[Apothean, Alyxian]] says "I'm sorry. You haven't much time left".

"You mean to say that perhaps this affliction is of your design?" says [[Viro of the Wood]]. A very sad, ghost of a smile "You've come all this way, all  this way to save me. Perhaps we'll find a way out of this together" says the [[Apothean, Alyxian]]. The smile fades "perhaps, you'll share my doom". He takes a very long, deep inhale.

The [[Apothean, Alyxian]] looks up to the sky and says: "We'll see each other soon, onward to [[Cael Morrow]]. I'll wait you there, in the Netherdeep".
