[[Kleion]] heads to the Sunctun Bazaar looking for egg-shaped jewelry. People complaining about the rain.

[[Hands of Ord]] whispering to each other about floods due to the excessive rain. It's been a desert for 800 yers. It might as well continue being a desert for the next 800 years.

[[Kleion]] manages to find an egg themed cart! [[The Earnest Eggporium]]! A lot of products shaped like eggs. Owned by a Kobold. Very energetic. They sell eggccessories. [[The egg Kobold]] deals only with egg-coins.

[[Fear, Nathan]] goes to the library! Very big. Welcomed by a man on his 30s. Distinctively human. Wearing a brown over-coat.

Demonology is the term about how Tieflings are made. At A7. Natural 1: no idea about the differences between demons and devils.

Rumors of the devils of those high in power direct hands of the Betrayer's Gods. They are independent of the gods. They make deals with people. Different records of people making deals with them. Most pacts end-up poorly.

Real frustrating. [[Fear, Nathan]] buys fruits and goes to the Opalite Forum.

[[Wysp Rigo]] and [[Viro of the Wood]] enter the [[Opalite Forum]] for a duel! Wysp, the Gladiator, floats in the sky, holding both of his swords. Viro makes the sword blade-less. Each picks one of the weapons up and begin the combat.

[[Viro of the Wood]] accidentally throws his sword to the corner. [[Wysp Rigo]] plays along and throws his sword too and goes to punch Viro. They pick the swords up and continue with the theater.

[[Fear, Nathan]] teleports to nearby the Life Dome. There, he feels being watched by something.

[[Jamil Alianta]] has a mission for us. There's a person we have to keep an eye on. Be spy on.

There's a [[Mysterious Elf]] downstairs, researching about the Betrayer's God. For the past two weeks. Find out what they're doing in the city of Ank'Harel. Learn if they're dangerous to the city.

Asked to find out if they own magic items that may be dangerous to the city.

The Life Dome is managed by [[Carliale Kroogan]]. His great-great-great-grand father built it back in the day. The [[Allegiance of Allsight]] sends agents every month to check if everything is working well.
