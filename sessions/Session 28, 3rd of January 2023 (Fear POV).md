#session 

[[Rhiordan Khine]] guides us to the [[Cobalt Soul]]'s [[Temple of the Mentor]]. Rhiordan wants to take us to the High Curator. But it does not seem to be simple to get access to them. Rhiordan tries to convince the orc at the front-desk. He cast a charming spell towards the front-desk.

[[Rhiordan Khine]] lifts the chain of "restricted access only" and invite us to pass through. He takes us to the second level of the temple. To a very cozy college study area. Square tables, chairs under the table. Many books piled up.

One person sitting with their back to us. Perhaps a man. A quill moves very quickly, over a book in front of them. Has very tanned skin. Very short, curly hair. A long, white robe that flows over their shoulder.

This person turns to us with a paternal gaze. Very gentle. Seems to be a leader of the Cobalt Soul. Asks who we are. The quill seems to be magical. Or at least to be used by an invisible hand.

[[Jamil Alianta]], High Curator of the Cobalt Soul. [[Rhiordan Khine]] then proceeds to tell Jamil that [[The Party]] comes from [[Bazzoxan]] and from the [[Betrayer's Rise]]. They seem to be interested in news from there.

[[Jamil Alianta]] asks the party if he can record his conversation with [[The Party]]. Also: Babagaerschel. We all sit around the table. Chairs move to our direction by themselves. A lot of magic happening in this room.

Turns out Baba is a title given to [[Herschel Rigo]] and [[Wysp Rigo]]. So much lore drop today. So much learned. Canon.

[[Jamil Alianta]] was not aware of the presence of the [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]] and the [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]] in [[Bazzoxan]]. He seems pleased to learn that, and is somewhat proud o [[Rhiordan Khine]], for bringing [[The Party]] to him.

[[Ruidium]] triggers some seriousness in [[Jamil Alianta]]'s face. "Ruidium in Bazzoxan? It's impossible". What is Ruidium? He's pensive about what to tell us. He doesn't seem to know much about it. It seems to be originated here in the continent of Marquet. Seems to be totally isolated on the continent only. It's a substance he didn't have a lot of opportunity investigating himself. One that is proving to be particularly volatile. What does *volatile* means?

[[Rhiordan Khine]] for some reason feels like he has to leave and he just: leaves. [[Jamil Alianta]] threatens us. Some powerful entities involved.

[[Jamil Alianta]] doesn't know Alyxian. He has never heard of his name. The Apotheon is folk tale. Local story to Marquet.

[[Kleion]] and [[Viro of the Wood]] talk about and show the [[Jewel of Three Prayers]]. Cute moment where [[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] shows trust towards Kleion. After [[Jamil Alianta]] learns about it, he invites to his private office. We were speaking on a sort-of public space so people could've heard us. Nobody suspicious out there (rolled a 5 perception).

[[Jamil Alianta]] identifies the [[Jewel of Three Prayers]] and returns it to [[Viro of the Wood]]. We proceed to speak about [[Ruidium]], the Apotheon and our visions.

A **lot of lore**. TL;DR; do not trust [[Allegiance of Allsight]] or [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]]. Keep an eye on [[Jamil Alianta]] also.

Henry the Bag. They're great.
