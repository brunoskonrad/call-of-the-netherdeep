And the [[Mysterious Elf]] chase begin! Everybody gets invisible. Let's go!

Many books in regards on the betrayers gods, pre calamity studies. Hard to tell what book specifically they were reading. There's a book that is slight pulled out from the rest. The **Cloaked Serpent** (Book).

[[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] tries to jump to the far roof and misses it, falling on top of the carriage the [[Mysterious Elf]] was about to enter.

[[Viro of the Wood]] and [[Fear, Nathan]] try to run for the cart. Viro attempts to throw Nathan towarsd the cart, for Fear to hold on there, but fails to do so. Fear lands with his face on the muddy ground. What a day.

They both have a chat and decide to go for drinks or something.

[[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] and [[Wysp Rigo]] are on the chase! Let's go, folks!

To the Scrolls Alcove. The [[Mysterious Elf]] is our neighbour. Like, really.

Cold, quiet, feat. Viro's poem. The earth was harmed by outsiders, from his clan. Cold, quiet, feet. 

[[Fear, Nathan]] reads his favourite poem, **A Thank-you Note*** to [[Viro of the Wood]] in return. They chat a bit about themselves.

[[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] prepares for the meet-up with [[Ayo]]. [[Fear, Nathan]] and [[Viro of the Wood]] helps him dress up a bit better. Fear puts make-up on him. Viro offers his hat.

[[Wysp Rigo]] is keeping watch outside. Upon return, he engages in COMBAT with [[Fear, Nathan]] and [[Viro of the Wood]]. Viro casts Calm Emotions and they talk. They sort-of resolve themselves.

[[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] goes to the date with [[Ayo]], let's go. Ayo and their party are on mercenaries' work at the moment. Ayo is avoiding eye contact with Ozark.

[[Ayo]] pulls a black card with a red circle on the center. Perhaps representing the red moon of Ruidus. Perhaps from [[Vrill]].

They're paying the Rivals a good amount of gold to keep an eye at the casino. There are reports that someone will try a heist on the place. They're security guards at the place.

[[Ayo]]: "[[Ozark the Scale Tamer]], I have a question for you. The guy they've been following from the Emerald Groto. How important is him to you?"

"He feels like he's a lost and tortured soul. We are the only ones he can talk to. For me it feels like a calling of sorts. Him personally. I just want to help him."

"What if it's like, dangerous? Like, really dangerous. What if he's not who you think he is?"

"There is something off. The last few visions I had, one of them was from Evandra, the Changebringer. It was almost like she was pleading with me, in that dream. I've never felt this kind of responsability, I don't know how to take it, honestly."

"So you guys had more God vision, uhn?"

"I... Yeah."

"Don't you think it's kind of weird that we've been ther with you and you guys got this... This calling? And we haven't been really affected by it? Not the way you had. I don't have a God on speed dial."

"Yeah, that is a bit strange. But..."

[[Ayo]] sips from her drinks and tries to put it together.

"I mean, if we look back at it, you guys were out of the room when [[Wysp Rigo]] grabbed the jewel, so..."

"We travelled with you guys too, to Baxxoxan. We've been in the Betrayer's Rise. We've been into the Crystal room. [[Irvin]] lost his arm, for whatever is in that amulet."

"That brings something that I want to ask you: is [[Irvin]] here?"

"We left him in Baxxoxan"

"Herschel swear they've seem him"

"I guess my point is... Why you guys? Why is this whole big responsability on you?"

"I have no idea... Honestly, I don't think we are that special. We're just a bunch of fuck ups that stumbled on the wrong place, the right time."

"And can someone else take care of that for you?"

"Is that what you wanna do?"

"Maybe a little bit. I mean, you're not the only one that feels like had made this journey for something. But as you say, you've got a lot of things to do in Ank'Harel. This is one of a number of threads."

"You feel cheated out of this, don't you? You've talked about it before. You want to feel part of something. And we stole it from you. [[Ayo]], regardless of that, you're a part of this. You're on your own path. And it coincides with ours. Maybe it's not the grand adventure you're looking for, but parhaps it it's around the corner."

She kinda softens.

"It's not me." her eyes track back to the card "Look... There are certain people that know what you have. And are very interested in it. People that I don't think you want on the wrong side of."

"I feel that might be a little too late..." and he looks at the card.

"The way I see this is... If you trust me with the amulet, I can make sure it gets put in good use. And you guys can walk away of this while we  take care of it. Or I don't know what's gonna happen."

"Do you know about the Ruidium. The drow woman in Baxxoxan, that's what was covering her. We found a sword covered on it."

"Tell me about the sword."

"You already knew..."

"Knew about what?"

"Please, you don't need to lie to me."

"Lie, me?"

"Look... I'm on your side. I just have a bad feeling about those people (the [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]])"

"They're working to do something no one else has done before, Ozark. They're getting into things others don't have the courage to... It's exciting to be in the front of something, not to be chasing after... Other people's big adventures. Theyr methods might be a little... Much, but, I really think they got a shot on what they're trying to do. And I'm really worried that you and your friends are in their way. I like your make-up, by the way."

"Th-th-thank you. Uuh... I can try to see where you're coming from this. And as I said: I trust you. And if you really want for us to step aside, that's a group decision. I'll talk with them. If we agree, we will hand it over to you. BUT, if we don't, we may have to go up against you."

"I really don't want it to come to that. There are other great quests, other great adventures. I just, I don't want to see you guys get hurt. I don't wanna see you get hurt."

"And I don't wanna see you get hurt either."

She just pocket the card back.

"Whatever that amulet is, they seem to think it is a key. Something they've been trying to unlock for a while now. I might've told them I was coming here, setting up this meeting. Before things get ugly."

"I told I've talk to my party about it. I just don't want you to think we're not friends. I still consider you guys my friends. Yeah, I'm gonna go. Good to see you." she puts a hand on [[Ozark the Scale Tamer]]'s shoulder.

"Before you go" and hands 10 gold to [[Ayo]].

As [[Ayo]] goes to leave. Her harpoon has, on the tip of it, it's made of Red Crystal. They're fucked.

[[Wysp Rigo]] and [[Fear, Nathan]] go play some dice. Fear wins 100 gold and leaves. Fear gets pickpocketed TWICE by a Tabaxi.
1. First she stole 30 gold
2. Then she stole the **Bracelet of Flame**

[[Fear, Nathan]] subtle casts charm person on her, it succeeds and he gets the bracelet back.

They both leave the Casino to the night outside.
