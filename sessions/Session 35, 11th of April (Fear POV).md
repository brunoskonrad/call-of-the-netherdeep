[[Herschel Rigo]] and [[Kleion]] are asked by [[Jamil Alianta]] to stay behind. They go upstair to Jamil's office to talk. He has a matter of urgent importance. And he needs Kleion for.

"Your friends are still working to prove themselves to the [[Cobalt Soul]]. However you're already a full expositor (to [[Kleion]])". Jamil asks Kleion to depart temporarely from [[The Party]].

[[Herschel Rigo]] says that it sounds important. And agrees to tell the party about it. [[Kleion]] has a moment of sadness for departing, but always had some reservations towards the call [[The Party]] received.

"It's not forever. For a couple of weeks at most. I'm sure you're gonna see each other agains." says [[Jamil Alianta]].

[[Herschel Rigo]] reminds [[Kleion]] about the matching armours they promised to make together. Herschel say some nice parting words, they hug each other. Kleion told the party to keep the goods he had with him. They're stached at [[The Apartment]].

[[Ozark the Scale Tamer]] spills the tea about [[Ayo]] joining the [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]].

The party had a long conversation. A lot of things. We are at war, now. With the [[Rivals]] and the [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]]. We are a family.

[[Jamil Alianta]] calls on [[Seraphine]]. She goes upstairs to his office, and Jamil asks her what her intentions are. "Seeks for knowledge, not afraid of a little bit of danger".

[[Jamil Alianta]] offers [[Seraphine]] the opportunity to be a full expositor at the [[Cobalt Soul]]. He asks her what she knows about [[Cael Morrow]]. "A big whole in the Sigil district".

Single table, west wall. Chairs. Stove that is cold. Far side of the room, a bunch of candles and a writing on the ground. Corpse of a giant snake.

The room fucking exploded. Everything went to shit.

We ran away. Moorbounder run. Side chair ride with [[Viro of the Wood]]. Morok run. Wysp run.

[[Wysp Rigo]] met up with [[Apothean, Alyxian]]. Wysp is kind-of traumatized. Alyxian was corporeal for a moment, and appreciated Wysp's gesture to cover him up.

[[Herschel Rigo]] is an angel now. Always was, though.
