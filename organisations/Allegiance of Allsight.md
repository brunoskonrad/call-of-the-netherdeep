#organisation

Not too much known about their goals and aspirations.

The Allegiance of Allsight seems to own access to the mines/place where Ruidium can be mined/extracted. Information came from Consortium of the Vermilion Dream's Vrill.

They seek to discover and procure the [[Ruidium]] so that they can learn about it. More in detail. Highly respected organisation of scholars. Headmasters Lacritos and Cryon from the Crystal Ch√¢teau. Told by Jamil. He doesn't believe in this, he just says like he follows a line.

Not trustworthy.
