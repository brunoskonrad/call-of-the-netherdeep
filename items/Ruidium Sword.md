Sword made out of [[Ruidium]]. Unknown powers.

Was in the hands of [[Kruuk]]. Discovered by Fear and Herschel while investigating his backery.

[[The Party]] managed to steal this sword from a gnome *probably* member of the [[Consortium of the Vermillion Dream]].

It was hidden inside [[Henry, the Bag]]. Unfortunately Henry is linked to a room on our plane of existance. Likely linked to a thief's guild.

Allegedly in the hands of the [[Sentinels of Memory]].
